If you have any links you'd like to add please submit a PR or and Issue and we'll merge it in as soon as possible. :)

PR should follow some of these guidelines:

  - Added lines should include a parenthetical credit to whoever's work it is (if available)
- A brief description that describes what the links contain and why they'd be good for beginners
